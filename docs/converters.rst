Converters
==========

Converters can be connected to the main petyl contract. 
Depending on the tokens, the converter is able to mint and burn from one or more token contracts. 
This allows for both the creation and conversion of tokens. 

Use Cases
=========

- Founder tokens that vest over time.
- Onboarding exisiting ERC20 tokens and converting them to base tokens.
- Converting base tokens to dividend tokens.
