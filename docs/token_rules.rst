Token Rules
===========

Base tokens have a smart contract hook which allows an arbitary set of rules be attached to the movement of those tokens.
There are a number of use cases where this is interesting. 

Examples
========

Restrict project founders from selling tokens before a set vesting date
Limit tokens to be traded between employees or investors on a whitelist
Automated compliance for specific asset types
