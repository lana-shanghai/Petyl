Time based conversions of tokens are made by creating a base token with rules and a token converter. 
The token rules can be as abitary or complex as written in Solidity. 
The user then calls the converter when these new options tokens meet the time based rules for transfer.

Examples include a tranch of founder shares which require 4 years vesting, which can be unlocked proportionally over time. 
Employee share offers are also possible with time based rules programmed in, with accounts checked off on a white list if conditions are met.
