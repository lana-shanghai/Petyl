Security Tokens
===============

Security tokens are a broad class of tokens used to represent digitally an asset or security as defined by a certain jurisdicion.
We don't claim to know every jurisdiction and its requirements, however a number of classes of security tokens can be build from components of the Petyl protocol.


Components
==========
Full list of functions can be found in the Reference docs. 

Partitions
==========
Different tranches or classes of shares can be represented by seperate tokens, mapped by the main Petyl contract.

Documents
=========
The main Petyl contract for each new venture comes built in with Documents

Distribution of Proceeds
========================
We have a dividend token type as part of the Petyl protocol

Transfer Restrictions
=====================
These requirements can be met by attaching token rules to either a base token or dividend token.
Different rules can be applied to each partition directly, with different partitions, different juristictions or classes of holders. 
Time based functions within the token rule contracts also allow for token vesting or cooling off periods for certain transactions and conversions.
