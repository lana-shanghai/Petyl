Petyl is a smart contract framework 

.. note::

    This project relies heavily upon ``web3.py`` and the documentation assumes a basic familiarity with it. You may wish to view the `Web3.py docs <https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ if you have not used it previously.

Features
========

* Contract testing via `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_, including trace-based coverage evaluation
* Property-based and stateful testing via `hypothesis <https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/tree/master/hypothesis-python>`_
